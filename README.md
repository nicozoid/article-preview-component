This is a solution to a [challenge on Frontend Mentor]().

### Learrnings
- My first use of JavaScript!

### Challenges
- Getting the image aspect ratio and auto-resizing to work well and responsively. I'm doing this in a bit of trial and error way rather than really understanding the CSS logic. Something to work on.
- The share-menu positioning works very differently on mobile and deskop. I overcame this by splitting this into two separate elements, but this complicated the JavaScript.
- The desktop share-menu needed to be positioned relative to an element within a `overflow: hidden` element, without itself being affected by `overflow: hidden`. I overcame this by positioning the share-menu in a wrapper just outside the said element.

### Current process
1. Create HTML, inc. containers & class names, inc. text styles.
1. Create variables (e.g. color, spacing). 
1. Text styles: define classes (direct from figma), import fonts.
1. Full CSS for mobile.
1. Define hover states and transitions
1. Adjust the CSS as needed for tablet and desktop

### Questions
Always interested in thoughts on whether there is a point in learning any this given the state of AI. I'm learning frontend coding in the belief that AI code still needs human oversight and I can't provide that oversight without coding proficiency. I wonder if even that will be true in a year though.# testimonials-grid-section
